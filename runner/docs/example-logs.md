# Runner Logs

As the runner encapsulates and manages the execution of system commands, it's important to note that most system commands, such as `ls` or `pwd`, produce output that is directed to `STDOUT`.

With this responsibility in mind, the runner is designed to capture all output generated by the system command and store it in a property or variable called `logBuffer`. This `logBuffer` contains all the logs generated during the execution of the command.

Users can retrieve these logs using the `.Logs()` method, which returns the logs stored in the runner object as a string. It's worth mentioning that reading logs using `.Logs()` does not remove or destroy the logs already read. This means that the `.Logs()` method can be used repeatedly to access the same logs without affecting their availability.

Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/tuhin37/gocomponents/runner"
)

var runr *runner.Runner

func init() {
    runr = runner.NewRunner("ls -l")
}

func main() {
    runr.Execute()
    fmt.Println(runr.Logs())
}
```

Output

```shell

`logBuffer` does not function as a ledger. Instead, with each `.Execute()` operation, the buffer is refreshed to contain only the logs from the latest execution. This ensures that the `logBuffer` accurately represents the logs produced by the most recent command execution, without retaining any logs from previous executions.
